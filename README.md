# Healthy Foodie - Recipes App (COMING SOON)

As part of Microverse Students, I have to complete a capstone projects, solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. This time is for React section.

This project is based in a catalogue of dogs [Catalogue of Dog Clothes](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32). As stated on the description I changed the subject (also I did not found any API on dog clothes :sad:). I decided to make a catalogue of recipes. It would be useful and flashy; who don't loves to see pics of food!

In branch dev you can find my latest code on this project!.
