As part of Microverse Students, I have to complete some capstone projects, solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. This time is for React section.

This project is based in a catalogue of dogs [Catalogue of Dog Clothes](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32). As stated on the description I changed the subject (also I did not found any API on dog clothes :sad: ). I decided to make a catalogue of recipes. It would be useful and flashy; who doesn't loves to see pics of food!
