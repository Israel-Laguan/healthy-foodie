## The Project

![app-banner][]

As part of Microverse Students, I have to complete some capstone projects, solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. This time is for React section.

This project is based in a catalogue of dogs [Catalogue of Dog Clothes](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32). As stated on the description I changed the subject (also I did not found any API on dog clothes :sad: ). I decided to make a catalogue of recipes. It would be useful and flashy; who doesn't loves to see pics of food!

Not a fan of Docker or need more information? Continue for instructions to learn more about how to setup your PC for run the frontend!

We used `create-react-app` to initialize this project, so it is configurated to be easy to run. Just follow the following instructions.

### Installing the project

Now that you are set up, open a terminal and:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Israel-Laguan/healthy-foodie.git
cd healthy-foodie
npm i && npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.

![app](docs/app.gif)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
